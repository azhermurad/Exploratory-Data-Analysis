# Emergency - 911 Calls Project

## Overview

The Emergency - 911 Calls Project aims to analyze and visualize emergency call data to uncover insights regarding call patterns, response times, and other critical metrics. By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), we seek to understand the factors influencing emergency call frequencies and identify trends over time.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 911 call records, including timestamps, types of emergencies, locations, and response times. Each record provides valuable information that can be analyzed to enhance emergency response strategies.

## Goals of EDA

1. **Understand Data Structure**: Examine the datasetâ€™s dimensions, data types, and summary statistics to get a foundational understanding of the available data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing values, duplicate records, and data inconsistencies to ensure data integrity.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features such as call hour, day of the week, and emergency type to facilitate deeper analysis.
4. **Trend Analysis**: Investigate patterns in call volume over time, such as peak hours, weekdays, and seasonal variations.
5. **Visualizations**: Create insightful visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, bar charts) to effectively communicate findings related to call distributions and response times.

## Key Findings

During the EDA, several key insights were discovered:

- **Peak Call Times**: Identification of specific hours and weekdays with the highest call volumes, indicating potential resource allocation needs.
- **Emergency Types**: Analysis of the most common types of emergencies reported, allowing for tailored training and resource planning.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Mapping of call locations to visualize areas with the highest demand for emergency services.
- **Response Time Trends**: Evaluation of response times across different types of emergencies to assess service efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting the analysis process.
